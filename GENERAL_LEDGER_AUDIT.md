## 2. FIELD MAPPING

### Critical Fields Analysis

| Field | Description | Required? | Modules That Populate |
|-------|-------------|-----------|----------------------|
| `account_id` | Bank/Cash account | ✅ ALWAYS | All modules |
| `party_id` | Customer/Vendor/Employee ID | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Only Receipts (newly added) |
| `party_type` | "customer"/"vendor"/"employee" | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Only Receipts (newly added) |
| `party_name` | Human-readable name | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Only Receipts (newly added) |
| `project_id` | Linked project | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Receipts, Expenses, Invoices, etc. |
| `transaction_type` | "inflow"/"outflow" | ✅ ALWAYS | All modules |
| `reference_id` | Source document ID | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Most modules |
| `vendor_id` | Vendor reference | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Vendor payments, Invoices |
| `customer_id` | Customer reference | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Sales returns, Credit notes |

### Module-Specific Field Population

| Module | account_id | party_id | party_type | project_id | vendor_id | reference_id |
|--------|------------|----------|------------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| Cashbook | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Self Transfer | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Receipts | ✅ | ✅ NEW | ✅ NEW | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Salary | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Stipend | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Incentive | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Commission | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Expense Recording | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Expense Refund | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Liability Settlement | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Purchase Invoice | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Sales Return | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Credit Note | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |

### Key Finding: ⚠️ `party_id` / `party_type` is NOT populated by most modules

Only the **Receipts** module now populates party metadata (recently added).
Other modules like Salary, Vendor Payments, etc. do NOT include party metadata.

---

## 3. FILTER LOGIC VERIFICATION

### Account Filter
**Status:** ✅ WORKING

```python
# Query for specific account
query = {"account_id": account_id, "created_at": {...}}
# Query for all accounts
query = {"created_at": {...}}  # No account filter
```

- When `account_id` is provided: Filters to that account ✅
- When `account_id = "all"`: Returns all transactions ✅

### Party Filter
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY WORKING

```python
if party_id:
    party_filter["party_id"] = party_id
if party_type:
    party_filter["party_type"] = party_type
```

- Filter logic is correctly implemented in backend ✅
- BUT most transactions don't have `party_id` populated ❌
- Only new receipts will have party metadata ❌
- Historical transactions won't be found ❌

**Issue:** The filter works, but there's no data to filter because party_id is missing from most entries.

### Project Filter
**Status:** ✅ WORKING

```python
if project_id:
    party_filter["project_id"] = project_id
```

- Filter logic correctly implemented ✅
- Most transactions have `project_id` populated ✅
- Will return transactions linked to that project ✅

## 4. CONNECTION VALIDATION

### Test: Create Receipt
**Entry Generated:**
```json
{
  "transaction_id": "txn_xxxx",
  "transaction_type": "inflow",
  "account_id": "acc_petty_cash",
  "project_id": "proj_xxxx",
  "party_id": "cust_xxxx",        // ✅ NEW
  "party_type": "customer",       // ✅ NEW
  "party_name": "Client Name",    // ✅ NEW
  "category_id": "customer_payment",
  "receipt_id": "rcp_xxxx"
}
```
**Counter Entry (Customer Advance):**
```json
{
  "transaction_id": "txn_yyyy",
  "transaction_type": "outflow",
  "account_id": "acc_customer_advance",
  "party_id": "cust_xxxx",        // ✅ Copied from primary
  "party_type": "customer",
  "party_name": "Client Name"
}
```
**Verdict:** ✅ COMPLETE - Both entries created with party metadata

---

### Test: Cancel Receipt
**Primary Reversal Entry:**
```json
{
  "transaction_type": "outflow",  // Opposite of original inflow
  "account_id": "acc_petty_cash",
  "project_id": "proj_xxxx",
  "is_reversal": true
}
```
**Counter Reversal Entry:**
```json
{
  "transaction_type": "inflow",
  "account_id": "acc_customer_advance",
  "is_reversal": true
}
```
**Verdict:** ✅ COMPLETE - Reversal entries created

---

### Test: Vendor Payment (Liability Settlement)
**Entry Generated:**
```json
{
  "transaction_id": "txn_xxxx",
  "transaction_type": "outflow",
  "account_id": "acc_petty_cash",
  "project_id": "proj_xxxx",
  "vendor_id": "vendor_xxxx",
  "reference_type": "liability_settlement",
  "reference_id": "liability_xxxx"
}
```
**Missing Fields:**
- ❌ `party_id` (not set to vendor_id)
- ❌ `party_type` (not set to "vendor")
- ❌ `party_name` (not set)

**Verdict:** ⚠️ PARTIAL - Entry created but missing party metadata

---

### Test: Salary Payment
**Entry Generated:**
```json
{
  "transaction_id": "txn_xxxx",
  "transaction_type": "outflow",
  "account_id": "acc_petty_cash",
  "category_id": "salary",
  "user_id": "user_xxxx",         // Has user ID
  "user_name": "Employee Name",   // Has user name
  "reference_type": "salary_payment"
}
```
**Missing Fields:**
- ❌ `party_id` (should be user_id)
- ❌ `party_type` (should be "employee")
- ❌ `party_name` (should be user_name)

**Verdict:** ⚠️ PARTIAL - Entry created but uses different field names (user_id vs party_id)

---

### Test: Expense Recording
**Entry Generated:**
```json
{
  "transaction_id": "txn_xxxx",
  "transaction_type": "outflow",
  "account_id": "acc_petty_cash",
  "project_id": "proj_xxxx",
  "category_id": "general_expense",
  "source_type": "expense_request"
}
```
**Missing Fields:**
- ❌ `party_id`
- ❌ `party_type`
- ❌ `party_name`

**Verdict:** ⚠️ PARTIAL - Entry created but missing party metadata

---

### Test: Journal Entry
**Via Cashbook with category `journal_entry`**

Journal entries go through regular cashbook flow and create standard entries.
They do NOT create double-entry pairs (excluded by design).

**Verdict:** ✅ WORKING (but no double-entry)

---

## 5. MISSING LINKS

### 5.1 Modules NOT Creating Party Metadata

| Module | Has Vendor/Employee Data | Creates party_id? | Impact |
|--------|-------------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Salary Payments | ✅ user_id, user_name | ❌ NO | Party filter won't find salary payments |
| Stipend Payments | ✅ trainee_id, trainee_name | ❌ NO | Party filter won't find |
| Incentive Payouts | ✅ user_id, user_name | ❌ NO | Party filter won't find |
| Commission Payouts | ✅ user_id, partner_id | ❌ NO | Party filter won't find |
| Liability Settlement | ✅ vendor_id | ❌ NO | Party filter won't find |
| Purchase Invoice | ✅ vendor_id | ❌ NO | Party filter won't find |
| Cash Disbursement | ✅ vendor_id | ❌ NO | Party filter won't find |

### 5.2 Modules NOT Creating Double-Entry

| Module | Creates Entry | Double-Entry? | Why |
|--------|--------------|---------------|-----|
| Liability Settlement | ✅ | ❌ | Settlement flow not updated |
| Purchase Invoice (Credit) | ✅ | ❌ | Daybook entry, liability separate |
| Sales Return | ✅ | ❌ | Daybook entry only |
| Credit Note | ✅ | ❌ | Credit note is special type |
| Cash Disbursement | ✅ | ❌ | Not updated for double-entry |

### 5.3 Financial Events Without Ledger Entries

|-------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----|
| Project Budget Change | ✅ | ❌ | Budget changes not tracked in ledger |
| Contract Value Change | ✅ | ❌ | Contract changes not tracked |
| Quotation Acceptance | ✅ | ❌ | No ledger impact until payment |

## 6. UI RECOMMENDATION

### Current State
- **Account Filter:** ✅ Fully functional
- **Period Filter:** ✅ Fully functional
- **Party Filter:** ⚠️ Implemented but data incomplete
- **Project Filter:** ✅ Mostly functional

### Analysis

The **Party Filter** is problematic because:
1. Only Receipts module populates `party_id`/`party_type`
2. Salary, Vendor Payments, etc. don't use standardized party fields
3. Historical transactions cannot be filtered by party
4. Requires significant refactoring to fully enable

The **Project Filter** is useful because:
1. Most transactions already have `project_id`
2. Can filter receipts, expenses, invoices by project
3. Provides value immediately

### Recommendation: **Option A - Keep and Fix Linkage**

**Rationale:**
1. Party filter is valuable for accountants (trace customer/vendor activity)
2. Project filter already works well
3. Fix is straightforward - add `party_id`, `party_type`, `party_name` to remaining modules

**Implementation Priority:**
1. ✅ Receipts - Already done
2. 🔶 Vendor Payments (Liability Settlement) - Add party_id/type/name
3. 🔶 Salary Payments - Add party_id/type/name
4. 🔶 Purchase Invoice - Add party_id/type/name
5. 🔴 Historical Data - Backfill script needed

**Alternative Option B - Revert** would lose the work already done on receipts and prevent useful future functionality.

---

## 7. ACTION ITEMS

### High Priority
1. **Add party metadata to Vendor Payment (Liability Settlement)**
   - Set `party_id = vendor_id`
   - Set `party_type = "vendor"`
   - Set `party_name = vendor_name`

2. **Add party metadata to Salary Payments**
   - Set `party_id = user_id`
   - Set `party_type = "employee"`
   - Set `party_name = user_name`

3. **Add party metadata to Purchase Invoice entries**
   - Set `party_id = vendor_id`
   - Set `party_type = "vendor"`
   - Set `party_name = vendor_name`

### Medium Priority
4. **Add party metadata to Stipend Payments**
5. **Add party metadata to Incentive/Commission Payments**
6. **Create backfill script for historical transactions**

### Low Priority
7. **Consider adding double-entry to Liability Settlement**
8. **Review Sales Return double-entry requirements**

## 8. SUMMARY

| Aspect | Status | Action Required |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Account Filter | ✅ Working | None |
| Period Filter | ✅ Working | None |
| Project Filter | ✅ Working | None |
| Party Filter | ⚠️ Partial | Add party_id to 6 modules |
| All Accounts View | ✅ Working | None |
| Receipt Entries | ✅ Complete | None |
| Vendor Payment Entries | ⚠️ Missing party | Add party metadata |
| Salary Entries | ⚠️ Missing party | Add party metadata |
| Double-Entry | ⚠️ Partial | 5 modules need update |

**Overall Assessment:** The General Ledger is functional for Account and Project filtering. The Party filter requires additional work to be fully useful. Recommend completing the party metadata implementation before considering the feature complete.
